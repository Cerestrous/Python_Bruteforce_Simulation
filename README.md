AIG - Shields Up: Cybersecurity Job Simulation

As part of the AIG Shields Up Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program with Forage, I engaged in a section titled "Bypassing Ransomware," which presented a scenario involving a server compromised by the Log4j vulnerability.

ðŸ”’ During this exercise, I was tasked with developing a Python script to perform brute-force decryption on files encrypted by ransomware, aiming to bypass the need to pay the ransom.

ðŸ’¡ Leveraging resources such as the rockyou.txt file, a Forage AIG Brute Force starter template, and Visual Studio Code, I customized and implemented a Brute Force script to recover critical files from the encrypted data.

ðŸŽ¯ This approach demonstrated how proactive measures in a real ransomware incident could potentially circumvent the necessity of paying the ransom.

This script is designed in Python to brute-force decrypt encrypted files by attempting various decryption keys.
